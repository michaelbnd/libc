# libc
Some C functions, feel free to use them !

The goal here is not to recreate the C Standart Library.

But more to add a level of abstraction to low level system calls like write() and read().
A lot of these functions already exists, and are probably made as well as mine (for sure), but this is not the point here.
A C programmer must be able to reproduce a part of the C Standart Library before telling that he mastered C.
